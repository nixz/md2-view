md2-view is just that, an Id MD2 model viewer. Nothing fancy. I'm in the
process of learning Common Lisp. In other words, don't look for elite Lisp
code here. ;)

Dependencies:
  lispbuilder-sdl
  lispbuilder-sdl-image
  cl-opengl

Running:   
  Load md2-view.lisp.
  The main function is MD2-VIEW:RUN.
  Give it a list of model file names to load.

Interface:
  * Mouse
      Left mouse button to rotate
      Middle button to zoom
      Right button to pan
  * Keys
      1 - top view
      2 - right view
      3 - front view
      4 - isometric view
      a - toggle animation (animation will not start at the last frame)
      b - toggle bounding boxes (disabled during animation)
      c - cycle line -> point -> face polygon modes
      g - toggle gnome (disabled during animation)
      h - print these commands
      i - print loaded models info to stdout
      l - toggle lighting (default OpenGL lighting is implemented)
      n - next frame (disabled during animation)
      p - previous frame (disabled during animation)
      q - exit
      s - cycle smooth -> flat shade models
      t - toggle textures 

TODO:
  * load .tga textures
  * fit function
  * zoom box function
  * more error checking (ensure frame counts match, catch zoom overflow)
